# Welcome!

This repo is a **blog** to show others how to create cool and interesting projects in Python. I provide in depth analysis on each of my projects and the underlying concepts that are used within them. My purpose in creating this is to inspire and educate others.

Feel free to have a look around and I hope you leave with a new or better understanding of a topic!
